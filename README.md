Theme: You Only Get One


	ISSUES
	 - Explosions should probably add the size of the object to the power.
	 - Explosive power should diminish with distance.
	 - Dying objects should should burn if they are slightly negative health.
	 - Trim particle effects - smoke is too heavy.
	 - Range of explosion is hard to see. Use pre-rendered explosions and use particles to enhance effect.
	 - Shrapnel should be visible detritus that has a small range but moves in a line beyond the extents
	   of the blast radius. Shrapnel should cause minor to medium damage.
	 - Add random factors to damage, radius?
	 - Leave rubble at destroyed fixed sites
	 - Animate robot
	 - Detect collisions?
	 - Robot should get knocked down and spark when taking small-medium damage
	 - Danger of explosion should hold for a moment as in chain reaction style games. Or otherwise
	   compensate for this with lots of shrapnel.
	 - Robot walk anim is a little too uniform.
